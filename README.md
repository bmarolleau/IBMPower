# IBMPower

This project is used to provide some sample Terraform scripts that can be used
to provision workloads to IBM Power Systems. The intent is that they can be
used as templates from which people can create their own Terraform scripts to
deploy their workload(s) of choice.

# PowerAI & K8s 

Provision a PowerAI as a Service using 
 helm install helm/nvidia-powerai  --name pwrai1 --set license=accept,service.externalIPs[0]=10.3.50.34,resources.gpu=0  --tls --namespace default
